### Response

I saved an interesting-looking article that argued for the end of Agile development to read later, but I couldn't find it. So, I read a similar article.

Just like many other buzzwords, the idea behind Agile itself is novel and can bring about positive transformation when implemented properly. However, just like with many other buzzwords, many organizations fail to adopt the concept properly, giving rise to a new genre of problems. Although I don't have expertise in this topic either, my impression of Agile development is that it promotes focused, flexible, and fast-paced development. I couldn't have imagined a scenario where one developer is part of five different Agile projects. Seventy-five minutes of daily standups every day? How can this person focus and make meaningful progress each day with five different projects circulating in their mind? Thankfully, I have only one Agile project to worry about this semester. But now that I think about it, I am enrolled in five different courses this semester... I hope this semester goes peacefully.

Seems pretty accurate an over abundance of bureaucracy always leads to things being slower.
